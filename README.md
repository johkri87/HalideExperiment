# HalideExperiment
The code in this repository is written for the image processing language named Halide.
For the official source to Halide, please visit the official site at http://halide-lang.org/.

The intent of the so-called experiment is to get an impression of how user friendly it is, both to set up locally and to use in its intended domain.
Results might be used in my master's thesis, possibly as a comparison to Equelle. http://equelle.org
